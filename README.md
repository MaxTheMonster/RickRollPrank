# RickRollPrank
I made  Rick Roll Bot :)

IF you would like to use the .exe file, go to **bin/Debug/RickRollBot.exe**

Drop this on your friend's system and watch their reactions.

*Now uses random intervals to stop the victim from counteracting it. *

Only works with **Google Chrome** I will be adding different versions which utilise other web browsers.

Have fun!
